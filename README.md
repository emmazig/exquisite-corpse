## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

Iâ€™ve taken a photo of the same place every two hours over the course of a day and I've combined them in this sketch to represent the passing of time. I took the seven photos and cut them each into seven pieces (representing the 14 hours of a day â€“1 photo every two hours for 14 hrs = 7 photos). I then uploaded them to my sketch and made them shuffle using the â€˜randomâ€™ function. I positioned all the sections together to create a single picture that switches up constantly.
We measure time by change, change in weather, change in how things look, how things feel. So I wanted to get this across with this sketch, I wanted to highlight the different shadows that were made throughout the day, the changing sky - how some things changed while other things stayed the same.
